# Burger

* Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.The app has featured MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM!

* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

* Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour it!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.

* The app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not

* Devoured burger listed on the right side of the page also has a trash icon. on clicking on the icon, the burger will be deleted from the database
